	  <h3>Life Long Learner</h3>
      <p>My biggest skill and strength in life is that I am a life long learner. I believe this is the number one reason I have been successful. I am constantly in search of learning new knowledge. Especially when it comes to technology areas. I love learning new programming concepts or new software programs. You have to understand that learning is a constant process that continues throughout life even past school and or college. </p>

      <h3>Problem Solver</h3>
      <p>One of the most important skills I have is the ability to problem solve. This is obviously a crucial skill for a programmer. As you will run into problems with your code and you have to be able to troubleshoot. This requires patience and determination which I have.</p>
